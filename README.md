🛍️ E-Commerce Product Listing Page
E-commerce platforms rely heavily on intuitive product listing pages that are easy to browse, filter, and search. A poorly designed product catalog can make shopping frustrating and reduce conversions.

View products in a grid layout
Use filters (category, price, rating)
Search for products easily
(Optional) View product details in a popup or separate page
